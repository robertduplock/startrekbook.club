Having trouble keeping track of who's who in the Titan crew? Hopefully this list will help.

I've excluded established characters such as Riker, Troi and Tuvok.

## Christine Vale

### Human female

2IC. Intitially reluctant to join The Titan crew over concerns that Deanna Troi's presence on Riker's senior command staff would impair his judgment. Has a bit of a thing for Jaza.

## Xin Ra-Havreii

### Efrosian male

Engineer aboard Titan. Worked on a design for the USS Luna, which underwent a terrible accident killing many of the crew. A bit of a ladies man. Has a thing for Pazlar.

## Ranul Keru

### Unjoined Trill male

A bearded and strongly built man, assigned as tactical officer and chief of security. The loss of his former lover Hawk at the hands of the Borg made him initially abrasive towards cybernetically enhanced Choblik Torvig.

## Doctor Ree

### Pahkwa-thanh male

A doctor that looks like an Earth dinosaur. Chows on raw meat. A nice guy once you get to know him.

## Jaza Najem

A deeply religious science officer. His wife and children died during the Bajoran occupation.

## Melora Pazlar

### Elaysian female

Head of Stellar Cartography/Chief Science Officer from a null gravity planet so she prefers to floar around rather than walk on the ground.
