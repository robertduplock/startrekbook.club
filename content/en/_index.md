Welcome! I am reading through all the Star Trek original novels set after Star Trek Nemesis. 
These are often referred to as the "relaunch" novels and cover Star Trek TNG, DS9, the spin-off Titan and a few 
others.

I will be reading them in loose chronological order.

Start with Star Trek The Next Generation: Death In Winter and join me, one book at a time.
