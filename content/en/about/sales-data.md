## Our patented tripolymer metagenic book sales predictor
### How we calculate a books commercial success (E.g. number of sales)

Book sales are notoriously difficult to find online. In fact it's pretty much impossible.

Instead we use a basic spreadsheet for tracking the number of reviews a book receieves on Amazon & Goodreads.

Our theory is the number of reviews (not the *score*, but the number of people who left any kind of review) gives us a rough indicator of the books commercial popularity. We take this overall score and put in 3 categories.

### Sales categories

* Below average
* Good
* Highly successful

This system is very much a work in progress and will likely be refined as we go.
