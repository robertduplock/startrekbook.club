The Borg are back... again. And they're hungry. They're eating starships. They're eating planets. They're back for revenge, and now only Seven of Nine can stop them... with a little help from her friends.

**Spoilers ahead!**

### History

Peter David is practically Trek Lit royalty. He penned the well-loved and respected standalone TNG novels _Vendetta_ and _Imzadi_ amongst many others. In fact, he was such a popular writer, Pocket Books editor John Ordover gave him the honour of creating and writing an entire literary spin-off series New Frontiers, which numbers an impressive 21 entries. 

And so Peter David was tasked with writing an entry into this new relaunch timeline, an entry that would continue on the Borg story from Resistance. This would be the last TNG novel David would write (although he wrote a handful of New Frontier novels after this one). 

### Story

Janeway is off to inspect the Borg ship that Picard, erm, _disabled_ in an earlier novel. Despite, the fact that Borg Queen is dead, it turns out the ship was just playing dead. And when it awakens, it assimilates Janeway.

Seven of Nine's spider-sense tells her Janeway is in trouble. Ruh-roh. So she grabs her hidden stash of gold-pressed latinum and rushes off in a ship owned by some dude called Grim Vargo, a character lifted straight out of Firefly. 

At some point, Picard gets wind of the situation and tries to help Seven out. They defy Starfleet orders _yet again_, (Picard Y U so naughty?) and concoct a hair-brained scheme to nab the doomsday machine and turn that bad boy loose on the Borg ship. All the least likable characters on the Enterprise mutiny. Meanwhile, the Borg ship now absorbs rather than assimilates. _It eats Pluto._ But Seven and the Doomsday machine start getting along just swell, so it puts the Borg ship down, but not before Janeway is nixed.

Lady Q bookends the novel, both causing Janeway to enter the Borg ship and also taking her off into the, _ahem_, afterlife. As it were. Because she is totally really dead. 

Oh and Spock is there for some reason..?
