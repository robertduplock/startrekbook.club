The Borg are back... again. And they're hungry. They're eating starships. They're eating planets. They're back for revenge, and now only Seven of Nine can stop them... with a little help from her friends.

**Spoilers ahead!**

### History

Peter David is practically Trek Lit royalty. He penned the well-loved and respected standalone TNG novels _Vendetta_ and _Imzadi_ amongst many others. In fact, he was such a popular writer, Pocket Books editor John Ordover gave him the honour of creating and writing an entire literary spin-off series New Frontiers, which numbers an impressive 21 entries. 

And so Peter David was tasked with writing an entry into this new relaunch timeline, an entry that would continue on the Borg story from Resistance. This would be the last TNG novel David would write (although he wrote a handful of New Frontier novels after this one). 

### Story

Janeway is off to inspect the Borg ship that Picard, erm, _disabled_ in an earlier novel. Despite, the fact that Borg Queen is dead, it turns out the ship was just playing dead. And when it awakens, it assimilates Janeway.

Seven of Nine's spider-sense tells her Janeway is in trouble. Ruh-roh. So she grabs her hidden stash of gold-pressed latinum and rushes off in a ship owned by some dude called Grim Vargo, a character lifted straight out of Firefly. 

At some point, Picard gets wind of the situation and tries to help Seven out. They defy Starfleet orders _yet again_, (Picard Y U so naughty?) and concoct a hair-brained scheme to nab the doomsday machine and turn that bad boy loose on the Borg ship. All the least likable characters on the Enterprise mutiny. Meanwhile, the Borg ship now absorbs rather than assimilates. _It eats Pluto._ But Seven and the Doomsday machine start getting along just swell, so it puts the Borg ship down, but not before Janeway is nixed.

Lady Q bookends the novel, both causing Janeway to enter the Borg ship and also taking her off into the, _ahem_, afterlife. As it were. Because she is totally really dead. 

Oh and Spock is there for some reason..? 

### Opinion

Okay, let's not mince words here. This book is an absolute clunker. Out of all the Trek books I have read so far, this is the first novel I've read that was simply poorly written. While I disliked _Resistance_ for its story and depiction of certain characters, it was not a badly written book. It just makes some creative mistakes.

_Before Dishonour_ is waffly and tediously over-the-top. Some of the dialogue has to be read to be believed such a thing could survive the editorial process. I understand _David_ is known to write lighter, more comedy focused Trek. And I have no problem with Trek comedies. _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_ is my favourite Trek movie. 

However, this book is just plain silly in parts. I didn't enjoy the character of Grim Vargo, who felt like a Firefly rip-off shunted into the Star Trek universe. I also didn't particularly appreciate how the first third of the novel focuses on Seven of Nine, despite this being a TNG novel.

I can't entirely blame _David_ though. It's obvious that many respected and experienced Trek writers were struggling to write and produce works that took place in these new, serialised, multi-book stories.
