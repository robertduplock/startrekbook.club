In Greek literature, there was a man who coveted the king's position. So the king agreed to let the man experience what it was like to have power. When the man took a seat at the throne, the king arranged to have a sword hanging above the man's head, held in place by a single thread. In this Titan novel, the sword is in fact "Erykon's Eye", and it dangles above an entire planet, threatening to unleash its awesome wrath. And _Titan_ is caught in the crossfire.

**Spoilers ahead!**

### History

It's hard to find much information about author Geoffrey Thorne. He has only written one Star Trek novel (this one). The book was written back in 2007. I believe Thorne had a Trek short story published in a Simon & Schuster anthology, and that presumably lead to the offer to write a full-length novel. 

Other than Trek, Thorne has written a smattering of short stories, tv scripts and comics. He was also once an actor!

In any case, he no longer appears to be active in the creative writing space. This is the fourth Titan novel all up, and it was a two-year gap between this one and the preceding novel, _Orion's Hounds_. 

### Story

The _Titan_ is merrily going about its way before it's stuck in some cosmic quicksand and can't seem to pull itself out. Warp is a no go. They determine the source of the spatial anomaly is coming from a nearby planet, Orisha.

So they tend a team out with the task of making contact with the Orishan's. But they're attacked and they dive into the anomaly for cover, only to find they have been sent back in time. Jaza and Modan are 1000 years in the past, but the rest only slip back by a few days.
