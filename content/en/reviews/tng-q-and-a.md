When Q comes on the TV, I groan and think _oh great this one is a Q episode..._ Can Keith R.A. DeCandido do the near-impossible and write a decent Q novel?

**Spoilers ahead!**

### History

Seasoned Trek author Keith R.A. DeCandido penned _Q&A_ shortly after writing the standalone novel _Articles Of The Federation._ DeCandido was approached by Pocketbooks editor Margaret Clark to write a post-nemesis novel. DeCandido pitched the idea of taking a little break from the Borg (crazy right) and explore the reason why Q was always so interested in humanity and Picard in particular.

Interestingly, DeCandido also did some freelance editing at Pocketbooks, so he would have been kept in the loop regarding the post Nemesis litverse.

After writing the book, he made a few changes so it fits in with the previous novel _Resistance_.
