Previous books in the relaunch timeline were criticised for their inconsistencies of tone, character and direction. Can Christopher L. Bennett tie it all together and set up the forthcoming _Destiny_ trilogy? Or will the litverse lay in ruins?

### History

Margaret Clark offered Bennet the opportunity to write this instalment of the relaunch timeline back in 2007-2008. So far the relaunch timeline hadn't met with huge success. Book sales appear to have been modest, and fans weren't taking to the new characters. And I'm guessing everybody was getting a bit sick of the Borg. 

_Bennet_ has said that one of his goals in writing _Greater Than The Sum_ was to, "give readers a greater understanding and appreciation of characters and events from its preceding novels." It seems that everybody agreed someone had to tie up some of the loose ends and get this literary franchise back on track.

Recognising "Borg fatigue" amongst the fans, bennet also stated that, although the Borg would be in the book, they would take a back seat in the story. Instead, it would focus on introducing a new character, T’Ryssa Chen, and a new form of life; a kind of planetary computerised intelligence that hasn't quite wrapped its head around procreation.  

He also consulted with David Mack, who was busily clacking away on his keyboard dreaming up the epic, forthcoming Destiny trilogy. Mr Bennet certainly had his work cut out for him.

### Story

The story starts by introducing the T’Ryssa Chen, a half-Vulcan-half-human who thoroughly eschews her Vulcan side. She blags her way onto an away mission to alleviate her boredom. While on the planet's, they meet some rather friendly and curious creatures (Noh Angels) but then the Borg show up and totally ruin the party.

These Noh Angels save T'Ryssa's life and demonstrate their awesome technology abilities while doing so. Meanwhile, T'Ryssa's ship (_U.S.S. Rhea_) is partially assimilated and she winds up aboard _Enterprise_, whose mission is three-fold; destroy the assimilated ship _Einstein_, rescue the _Rhea_ if possible and defeat the Borg.  

However, the Noh Angels have other ideas. They don't like to see people fighting, so they keep them separate. Meanwhile, the Borg are drilling into the Angel's planetary brain, sucking out all that delicious technology goodness. Picard, which Chen's help, must convince the peace-loving Noh Angels that they must intervene and defeat the Borg.

They are successful, but only partially. The epilogue ends with Leybenzon dying on the Borg ship, having accidentally delivered the Federation's secret weapon right into their hands.
