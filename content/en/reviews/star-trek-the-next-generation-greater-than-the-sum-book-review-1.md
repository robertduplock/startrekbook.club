Previous books in the relaunch timeline were criticised for their inconsistencies of tone, character and direction. Can Christopher L. Bennett tie it all together and set up the forthcoming _Destiny_ trilogy? Or will the litverse lay in ruins?

**Spoilers ahead!**

### History

Margaret Clark offered Bennet the opportunity to write this instalment of the relaunch timeline back in 2007-2008. So far the relaunch timeline hadn't met with huge success. Book sales appear to have been modest, and fans weren't taking to the new characters. And I'm guessing everybody was getting a bit sick of the Borg. 

_Bennet_ has said that one of his goals in writing _Greater Than The Sum_ was to, "give readers a greater understanding and appreciation of characters and events from its preceding novels." It seems that everybody agreed someone had to tie up some of the loose ends and get this literary franchise back on track.

Recognising "Borg fatigue" amongst the fans, bennet also stated that, although the Borg would be in the book, they would take a back seat in the story. Instead, it would focus on introducing a new character, T’Ryssa Chen, and a new form of life; a kind of planetary computerised intelligence that hasn't quite wrapped its head around procreation.  

He also consulted with David Mack, who was busily clacking away on his keyboard dreaming up the epic, forthcoming _Destiny_ trilogy. Mr Bennet certainly had his work cut out for him.

### Story

The story starts by introducing the T’Ryssa Chen, a half-Vulcan-half-human who thoroughly eschews her Vulcan side. She blags her way onto an away mission to alleviate her boredom. While on the planet's, they meet some rather friendly and curious creatures (Noh Angels) but then the Borg show up and totally ruin the party.

These Noh Angels save T'Ryssa's life and demonstrate their awesome technology abilities while doing so. Meanwhile, T'Ryssa's ship (_U.S.S. Rhea_) is partially assimilated and she winds up aboard _Enterprise_, whose mission is three-fold; destroy the assimilated ship _Einstein_, rescue the _Rhea_ if possible and defeat the Borg.  

However, the Noh Angels have other ideas. They don't like to see people fighting, so they keep them separate. Meanwhile, the Borg are drilling into the Angel's planetary brain, sucking out all that delicious technology goodness. Picard, which Chen's help, must convince the peace-loving Noh Angels that they must intervene and defeat the Borg.

They are successful, but only partially. The epilogue ends with Leybenzon dying on the Borg ship, having accidentally delivered the Federation's secret weapon right into their hands.

### Opinion

The first few chapters of _Greater Than The Sum_ seem to spend their time apologizing for the previous books. It almost retcons them, actually. Bennett covers aspects such as T'Lana's short stint as ships counsellor, Leybenzons resignation, inconsistencies with the Borg and a few other bits and bobs. I admire the idea, trying to clean up some of the past wrongs and creating a more congruent sense of continuity. At times it doesn't make for the most riveting reading, but I didn't mind it.

I suppose what I am saying is the message could have been a bit more balanced.

Bennet also introduces the new character of T'Ryssa Chen. She's sassy, quirky and very un-Vulcan. Although I didn't love every aspect of her character scenes, I still found her character a huge improvement over the dull and unlikeable T'Lana or Leybenzon. Also, I was glad to see Bennet didn't try to squeeze in too many new characters at once. Like _Sword Of Damocles_, I thought that focusing on a single character for the main part of the story was a good way to give the book a solid centre.

And then there is the theme of the book. Family, children and procreation. This theme is woven into just about every chapter. Chen has daddy issues. Picard doesn't want to start a family which Crusher due to his fear of a Borg incursion The Noh Angels don't get the concept of procreation but are keenly interested in the topic. And the liberated Borg (E.g. Hugh and his partner) are trying to find ways to make themselves capable of reproduction.

Of course, all these leads up to Crusher getting pregnant right as the Borg launch a devastating incursion into Federation space. This is basically a set-up for the forthcoming Destiny trilogy.  

Somehow I can't quite decide whether I liked the all-pervasive central theme of family/children/procreation or not. I think I did like the sense of theme running through the story, but I had two minor quibbles. Firstly, the theme was simply too enmeshed in every aspect of the story and lacked subtlety. Secondly, the book pushes a single message, that children are great and wonderous and you should have children even if a) You spend most of your life away from them on a starship or b) the Borg are coming to eff you up and murder everyone you love.

I suppose what I am saying is the message could have been a bit more balanced.

All that being said, Bennet does a lot of good things with _Greater Than The Sum_. He manages to bring one of his trademark big, wacky ideas and integrates it into an entertaining story. Chen is a welcome breath of fresh air. I also appreciated the book was a little "tighter" than Bennet's _Titan_ novel _Orion's Hounds_. 

### Reception

_Greater Than The Sum_ received generally positive reviews online. It holds an impressive "outstanding" rating on Trek BBS, with many people praising the new character of Chen. Trek Movie gave it a positive review, stating it featured, "\[..\] a unique new construct, effective use of thread-bare villains, and a heavy dose of character development." Trek Lit also gave it a glowing review, stating that the book, "\[...\] turned out to be a very thoughtful and compelling story." However, Unreality Sc-Fi were not such big fans, "To say _Greater than the Sum_ was an utter disappointment would be a huge understatement".

[Book sales were again modest](https://startrekbook.club/about/sales-data/), which at this point was the case for most relaunch Trek novels.

### The final verdict

While not a perfect novel, _Greater Than The Sum_ is one of the stronger books in the post-Nemesis litverse. It features a welcome cast shakeup with the introduction of Chen, who was a bit over-the-top but still an enjoyable addition to the Enterprise crew. The story is original, entertaining and cleverly moves the Borg into the back seat and focuses instead on the characters. Perhaps some of the themes could have been handled with a bit more subtlety. Very good, but not great.
